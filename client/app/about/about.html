			<p>When I was studying for my exam on binary search trees and heaps, I was somewhat dismayed that there weren't a lot of good visualization resources for 2-3 trees, left leaning red black trees, and AVL trees. Most of the pre-existing ones were published as Java applets and out of date. So as a side project, I decided to write an up-to-date visualizer that would work in modern browsers. Not only would this challenge me to better master SVG manipulation and D3, but it would also give me some good study practice for the coming final! For implementation details and source code, please see the Github link in the footer. :)</p>
